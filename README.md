### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and expanding my knowledge in the `DevOps` field. </br>
In the next probably few months I will re-write most of my scripts/apps and post them here.

Soon, I will also add a repo related to a `100 days coding` challenge.

Languages:
1. `Bash` 
2. Basics in - `awk`, `PHP`, `SQL`
3. `Python`
